# ExperimentPort
This repository contains all the basic files needed to set up experiments in our windows computers.
Proceed at your own risk if you haven't read the readme file in the RunningMachines folder.

m2html is not my own (license is included).  Used to create html documentation of helper functions.
You can access the documentation in MATLAB via help, or in documentation/index.html
Please regenerate the documentation if you make any pull requests involving helper functions.
